# hello-go-case

This is my unique greeting application in Go. 

## Prerequisties

Install Go. 

## Compile and Run

To compile and run locally: 

```PowerShell

go build hello.go
.\hello.go
```

## Go Code

In general, a GitHub repo would host a Go module.

Go modules typically have one or more Go packages that are then released together. 

A package is a folder that has one or more files. 

Have one default main() function that will execute when installed. 

## To Create A Similar App

Initialize a Go module first - be sure to use your GitHub account and repo name.

```PowerShell
go mod init github.com/denisecase/hello-go-case
```

Then add and test your go code. 

## To download and install this app locally

```PowerShell
go get -u github.com/denisecase/hello-go-case@latest
```

Remember to include the @latest - a version is needed.
